### Resources
Resources are folders with lua code and a meta file (meta.xml) to index included code, all resources are stored in this server folder whos name is surrounded with brackets to let's the server know it's a folder and not just one big resource. See "contributing" on main for more information about how to contribute to GTW-RPG or "installation" for detailed instructions in how you can install these resources on your own server. 

Each resource has a readme file with more information and requirements (other resources that must be running in order to use a specific resource). If you find any bug or other issues please report them to us, alternatively fork and post a pull request if you know how to solve the problem.
