## Resources
Resources are folders with lua code. They are based on a meta file (meta.xml) which is used to index script files within a sinlge resource. The reson for using brackets around the name of this folder is to let the server know it's dealing with individual resources and not just one big resource. See "contributing" in the root folder for more information about how to contribute to GTW-RPG, or "installation" for detailed instructions in how you can install these resources on your own server. 

Each resource has a readme file with more information and requirements. For instance which other resources that must be running in order to use a specific resource. If you find any bug or other issues please report them to us, alternatively fork and post a pull request if you know how to solve the problem by yourself, all help is appreciated.
