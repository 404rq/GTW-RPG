Rules in English
********************************************************************

#1 Do not spawn kill other players. (Applies around hospitals)
#2 Drive on the right side of the road. Do not block other 
    players, do not crash into other players unless you have 
    a reason to do so, e.g in a police chase or to revenge.
#3 Do not use any kind of hack or exploit bugs. GTW-RPG is an 
    open source game mode which we claim to be stable and of 
    high quality, it's therefore important to let us know about 
    any bug you may find. Bug reports are rewardable, exploits 
    are punishable.
#4 Do not advertise, feel free to talk about anything as long 
    you're not advertising it. If you don't get the difference 
    here's an example: Talking: xBox vs PS3... Advertising: 
    buy xBox here...
#5 Do not obstruct or interrupt role play situations. It's not 
    appropriate to show up with a minigun and kill a group of 
    players standing together chatting for instance, do not use 
    more violence than the situation require.
#6 Do not spam the chats, repeating nonsense on purpose will lead 
    to a mute, note that this mute are global and applies to many 
    other servers running GTW-RPG resources as well.
#7 Do NOT try this in game: apply for staff, suggest new features,
    complaint on other players or staff, ask about stuff you'll 
    find information about in the list to the left. This is not 
    punishable but you may not get the response you expected.
#8 Do not actively troll, provoke, annoy or insult other players. 
    Instead, solve your conflicts here:

Rules in Swedish (Svenska)
********************************************************************

#1 Spawn kill är ej tillåtet (gäller framförallt vid sjukhus)
#2 Håll till höger när du kör, blockera ej andra spelare, krocka 
    inte medveted med andra spelare om du inte har en anledning
    som exempelvis hämnd eller en biljakt (tjuv och polis).
#3 Missbruka inte eventuella buggar, GTW-RPG är baserat på öppen 
    källkod och bör vara stabilt, belöning utlovas till den som 
    upptäcker och rapporterar buggar beroende på dess storlek, 
    missbruk av buggar bestraffas.
#4 Reklam är ej tillåten, vi tillämpar yttrandefrihet så du får 
    självklart prata om precis vad du vill, så länge du inte öppet 
    gör reklam för en produkt exempelvis.
#5 Avbryt ej rolspel, servern stödjer både role-play och RPG, om 
    en grupp spelare står och sysslar med /me och /do rollspel är 
    det olämpligt att dyka upp med minigun och ha ihjäl dem eller 
    meja ner dem med din bil.
#6 SPAM är ej tillåten, toleransen här är dock hög men får du en 
    varning bör du lugna dig en aning.
#7 Administrativa uppgifter delas INTE ut till den som skriker 
    högst, detsamma gäller för serverns utveckling (förslag och 
    dylikt) samt klagomål på andra spelare med mera, allt sånt 
    hanteras i forumet.
#8 Att aktivt trolla eller provocera är ej heller tillåtet, lös 
    era konflikter här:
    Klagomål: http://forum.gtw-games.org/complaints-and-reports/complaints-rules-and-guidelines-357/

#1 Du må ikke gyde dræbe andre spillere. (Gælder omkring hospitaler)
#2 Kørsel på højre side af vejen. Bloker ikke andre
    spillere, ikke køre ind i andre spillere, medmindre du har
    en grund til det, fx i en politi jagt eller til hævn.
#3 Brug ikke nogen form for hack eller udnytte bugs. GTW-RPG er en
    open source game mode, som vi hævder at være stabil og
    høj kvalitet, er det derfor vigtigt at lade os vide om
    enhver fejl du kan finde. Fejlrapporter er rewardable, exploits

#4 Du må ikke annoncere, er du velkommen til at tale om noget, så længe
    du er ikke reklame det. Hvis du ikke får forskellen
    Her er et eksempel: Talking: Xbox vs PS3 ... Reklame:

#5 Du må ikke hindre eller afbryde rollespil situationer. Det er ikke
    hensigtsmæssigt at dukke op med en minigun og dræbe en gruppe af
    spillere står sammen chatter for eksempel, brug ikke
    mere vold end situationen kræver.
#6 ikke spam de chats, gentage nonsens med vilje vil føre
    til en stum, bemærke, at denne mute er globale og gælder for mange
    andre servere, der kører ressourcer GTW-RPG så godt.
#7 Du må ikke prøve dette i gmae: ansøge om personale, foreslå nye funktioner,
    klage på andre spillere eller medarbejdere, spørge om ting, du vil
    find oplysninger om i listen til venstre. Dette er ikke
    strafbar, men du kan ikke få det svar du forventede.

#1 Geen andere spelers spawnkillen. (Geld rond ziekenhuizen)
#2 Rijd aan de rechterkant van de weg. 
    Blokkeer geen andere spelers, rijd niet in andere spelers zonder een geldige reden. bv. in een politie achtervolging of wraak.
#3 Gebruik geen soort van hack of misbruik geen bugs. 
    GTW-RPG is een open source game modus waarbij we zeggen dat hij stabiel en van hoge kwaliteit is, het is daarom belangrijk dat je ons laat weten van een bug die je vind. 
    Bug reports zijn beloonbaar, misbruik is strafbaar.
#4 Adverteer niet, voel je vrij om over alles te praten zolang je het niet adverteerd. 
    Als je het verschil niet snapt dan is hier een voorbeeld: Praten: Xbox vs PS3... Adverteren: Koop je Xbox hier...
#5 Onderbreek of belemmer rolspel situaties niet. 
    Het is niet volwassen om met een minigun te komen en een groep van spelers die aan het praten zijn te vermoorden, gebruik niet meer geweld dan dat de situatie nodig heeft.
#6 Spam de chat niet, onzin herhalen met opzet zal leiden tot een mute, denk eraan dat deze mute globaal werkt en dus in alle andere GTW servers werken.
#7 Probeer dit spel NIET: soliciteren voor personeel, nieuwe kenmerken aanvragen, klagen over de andere spelers of personeel, iets vragen dat je in de lijst links van dit kan vinden. 
    Dit is niet strafbaar maar het kan zijn dat je je verwachtte antwoord niet krijgt.
#8 Ga niet actief trollen, provoceren, irriteren of spelers uitschelden. Inplaats daarvan, los je problemen hier op:

#1 Non spawn-killare gli altri giocatori. (Questa regola vale vicino agli ospedali)
#2 Guida sul lato destro della strada. Non bloccare gli altri
    giocatori, non schiantarti contro gli altri giocatori a meno che non hai
    una ragione per farlo, per esempio in un inseguimento o per vendetta.
#3 Non usare nessun tipo di hack e non abusare dei bug. GTW-RPG è una
    modalità di gioco open source che affermiamo sia stabile e di
    alta qualità, quindi è importante notificarci riguardo
    qualsiasi bug che riesci a trovare. Vieni ricompensato se segnali un bug,
    ma vieni punito se abusi di un exploit.
#4 Non pubblicizzare, sii libero di parlare di qualsiasi cosa purché
    non la pubblicizzi. Se non capisci la differenza, eccoti un
    esempio: Parlare: xBox vs PS3... Pubblicizzare:
    compra la xBox qua...
#5 Non ostruire o interrompere situazioni role play. Non è
    appropriato presentarsi con una minigun e uccidere un gruppo di
    giocatori che stanno insieme a parlare per esempio, non usare
    più violenza di quanto la situazione richiede.
#6 Non spammare nelle chat, ripetere cose senza senso porterà
    ad essere mutati,tieni conto che questo mute è globale e viene applicato a molti
    altri server che usano le risorse di GTW-RPG.
#7 NON fare questo nel gioco: chiedere per diventare staff, suggerire nuove idee,
    lamentarsi di altri giocatori o staffer, chiedere cose ovvie allo staff che
    puoi trovare nella lista alla tua sinistra. Questo non è punibile ma
    potrai non ottenere la riposta che ti aspettavi.
#8 Non trollare, provocare, annoiare o insultare gli altri giocatori.

********************************************************************
Staff guidelines (only relevant to server staff)
********************************************************************

You can enter the staff mode at any time you would like to do 
your staff duty by using the command /gostaff (or /gostafff 
for female skin). This mode makes you invincible and are 
strictly forbidden to use during game play.

Staff panel are located at F7 and are used at your own risk,
we do not make refunds in case it has bugs which makes you 
lose anything when it's used the wrong way or overused.

Abusing the staff panel will lead to a kick without warning, 
with abusing means using it to gain advantages over other 
players or by giving another player free weapons or tools.

NOTE: For previous staff, you do not need to apply again, 
just send a PM to MrBrutus in the forum with your account 
name to get added again, this is a security check to prevent 
old staff account names from being exploited.

NOTE2: Use built in features in the first case, vehicles must 
be spawned using /gv, otherwise it's your responibly to clean 
up since vehicles from the staff panel won't be removed 
automatically and may cause lag if overused.

NOTE3: Warp using staff panel may still cause you to loose your 
weapons so use /setpos x y z for safely warps anywhere on the 
map or warp to player. Never warp a player to you, alwasy warp 
to the player if you are gonna warp.

NOTE4: [GTW] Tags are not required, when youre in the staff 
team "Government" you're a staff, otherwise youre a regular player 
with some extra basic advantages.

NOTE5: Vehicles spawned from /gv are only for transportation of 
staff members, the rental cost are free and they are therefore 
strictly forbidden to use while working, exceptions are if youre 
testing a bug or can prove that youre doing it as a staff.

The smaller square blips on your radar indicates a place where 
you can rent a vehicle, either for work or casual driving. The
color shows the difference, white means casual driving and 
anyone will be able to rent a vehicle there, these are often 
located nearby gas stations and busy areas in general like 
hospitals, police departments etc..

Other colors like yellow, light blue or gray indicates job 
vehicles, that means you must be employed in the required job 
in order to use them, those markers are always located close 
to the job site itself so you can't miss them.

The rental cost works like a pledge, you pay a relatively 
expensive price to rent the car but don't worry, if the car 
is in good shape when you return it you'll get most of the 
money back. The most expensive vehicles are trains and large 
aircraft which may get as high as 1000$, as long you drive 
carefully it's a cheap price.]] },
	{ "Vehicle shops", 1, [[
Of course a better option than crappy rental vehicles is to 
buy your own vehicle, there are plenty of vehicle shops 
areound the map often marked with a car, bike, boat, airplane 
or train icon. All available vehicles can be bought and managed 
in the vehicle GUI which is appears when you press 'F2'

Owned vehicles are personal and can be shown/hidden as you wish
You can have multiple vehicles visible at the same time in case 
you want to let a friend drive one of your vehicles, you don't 
have to worry about blownup vehicles either, they're just broken 
until you pay for a recovery or call a mechanic to fix them which 
is 80% cheaper than recovery.]] },
	{ "Vehicle commands", 1, [[
Here's a list of the available commands related to vehicles:
-- Gearbox:
/drive     # Switch to the 'drive' gear witch saves fuel but makes 
             your car slower
/sport     # Default vehicle handling, this is a blanaced option
/race      # Switch to the 'race' gear which consumes a lot of fuel 
             but let's you accelerate really fast, this will have 
             more effect on expensive sports cars used for streat 
             races for example.
           
/gearup    # Next gear above current
/geardown  # Previous gear below current
/nextgear  # Toggle next gear, goes back to the first gear when the 
             end of the list is reached.
 
-- Door control 
/cd\[0-6\] # Close all vehicle doors or an individual door from inside
/od\[0-6\] # Opens all vehicle doors or an individual door from inside

-- Turn indicators
/warn      # Toggle hazard lights
/lleft     # Toogle turn indicator to left
/lright    # Toggle turn indicator to right

-- Misc
/engine    # Start/stop the vehicle engine
/lock      # Lock/unlock the doors of your vehicle
/emlight   # Toggle emergency lights, works on Police vehicles, 
             Firetrucks, and ambulances, a great way to get 
             attention in emergency situations when you need 
             a clear road.

 long to the first stop, you will be paid every time you hit 
 a busstop and money will be removed if your vus are damaged.

Farmer:

As a farmer you need to buy a tractor and a combine harvester, 
it's also recomended to buy a house country side (not required

your tractor and plant with the command /plant or press the 'N'
key. Each plant cost you some money and take up to an hour to 
grow. 

Luckily you don't have to wait all that time, meanwhile 
you can do other stuff, even leave the server if you wish, 
just remember to come back and harvest them with your combine 
harvester within three hours or they will rotten, be aware of 
other farmers as well since they may steal your plants.

Farmers can legally kill other farmers if they are a threat, 
you may also work together with other farmers as a team. 
After harvesting a plant, all you gotta do it so step out and 
pick it up, the profit in this job is extremly high so it's 
probably our most well payed job. Also the most risky one.

You can become a farmer at "the farm", south side of San Fierro

	{ "How to arrest", 1, [[
All law units get's a free nightstick, this is used to arrest a 
wanted player, simply hit the suspect once to arrest him. After 
the arrest you'll take him to jail which is inside all police 
departments, all the way to the cellblocks where you walk up to 
the cell to deliver the suspect. ((Yes you can also choose which 
cell)).

At the larger police departments there is a light ammu nation 
shop where law units can buy useful equiptment like silenced 
pistol (tazer which will freeze the suspect for a while), 
teargas, M4 and MP5 which are common useful guns in the law 
section as well as body armor and much more.

If a suspect is obviously violent you can do a kill arrest, by 
that you will simply shoot the suspect in place to get paid. 
The payment is lower than a regular arrest so try avoid this.]] },
	{ "How do I know who's wanted?", 1, [[
There are many ways, the command /wanted output's a list of wanted 
players names and their current wanted level

Another way is regular patrolling, a wanted player will probably 
act suspicious by trying to escape when he see's you or somethnig 
like that, if not you can stop him anyway just to check, to do so, 
simply press X to show the cursor and click on the suspect, a menu 
will open in where you select "Check if wanted", you will then find 
out if the player is wanted or not.

A third way is to check for a text at the bottom of your screen 
saying somethnig about distance, that means a suspect is nearby
and you'll getting an approximate distance telling you roughly
where the suspect is hiding. You'll have to look a lot so a 
helicopter is required as well as temwork between law uints.]] },
	{ "Law chat", 1, [[
All government units has access to the emergency chat /e <text>,
keep other law units updated with your current status, call for 
backup etc, this chat is also useful if you need firemen or medics,

team.

useful if violent criminals attack you.]] },

	{ "Store robberies", 1, [[
There are around 100 shops around San Andreas which you can rob at 
any time for quick money, any clothes shop, ammu nation, fast food 
restaurant or general store can be robbed by aiming a weapon at the 
face of the salesman behind the desk. 

You will then be noticed by a text on your screen telling you how 
much time you must stay to get the money, during this time you can't 
leave the store or getting arrested. If you do the robbery is 
interrupted.

Robberies are mostly depending on the amount of cash in the store, 
a higher wanted level means more cash but it's still hard to know 
how much you can get. One thing is for sure, it's often worth it.]] },

'Create'.

Go criminal by using the command /criminal then you'll enter 
any turf to provoke it, after provoking it you must hold it 
and defend it from others that might be interested in it, 
especially the current owner. Turfs will pay out to entire 
gangs with a couple of hours delay and you'll earn some money 
after capturing it as well. 

There are turfs spread out over the entire map so try to focus 
on one specific area if possible to make it easier to defend 
them from other gangs.]] },
	{ "Gangsters", 1, [[
Any criminal that get's shot inside a turf becomes a gangster, 
gangsters will not gain wanted level from killing other gangsters
which is a huge advantage since the law units has an easy time 
arresting people that is practicating in a turf war. Allthought 
you don't want to get killed since you'll lose your weapons.]] },
	{ "Reduce wanted level", 1, [[
Your wanted level will start to reduce after you commit a crime
if there isn't any cops nearby and the crime wasn't too serious.
Serious crimes makes you violent, you'll see a count down timer 
in your hud telling you for how long you'll be violent, when that 
time reaches zero your wanted level will reduce.

Stay away from cops and other government units is the best way to 
reduce, you can do so by either buy a house and hide inside or by 
traveling out contry side and hide somewhere where there isn't 
many other players around.

You can also pay a fine by doing /fine or /surrender, this is often 
pretty expensive and you'll may loose all the money you erned from 
the crime, this is also useless when a law unit is nearby.]] },
	{ "Bribery", 1, [[
You can bribe corrupt cops at your own risk, note that you may 
getting scammed if you do but theoretically you can bribe.

First talk to the cop who arrested you to see if he's interested,
if he accept use the /give <player_nick> <amount> command to send 
the money or visit any bank or atm, the cop will then use the 
/release command to release you. You will still be wanted so be 
careful.]] },

The Jail is located on it's own island built by concre on top of 
smaller rock islands behind the mountains just west about Bayside 
Marina, this is a place full of hiding spots, a place where cops

trying to escape, (yes you can escape).

7 guard towers with rockets will fire at anything coming nearby 
except for law units, unless they are trying to help a criminal 
escape. The place is only reachable by boat or helicopter and 
prison guards has multiple spawners for these vehicles around 
jail.

To escape, you need to get far away from the jail, unnoticed and 
survive both rockets and potential guards that may notice your 
escape attempt, a successfull escape attempt will  gice you 10 
stars, (making it the worst crime you can commit).
