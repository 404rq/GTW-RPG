***********************************************************************

#1 Do not spawn kill other players.
#2 Drive on the right side of the road. Do not block other players, do not crash into other players unless you have a reason to do so, e.g in a police chase or to revenge.
#3 Do not use any kind of hack or exploit bugs. GTW-RPG is an open source game mode which we claim to be stable and of high quality, it's therefore important to let us know about any bug you may find. Bug reports are rewardable, exploits are punishable.
#4 Do not advertise, feel free to talk about anything as long you're not advertising it. If you don't get the difference here's an example: Talking: xBox vs PS3... Advertising: buy xBox here...
#5 Do not obstruct or interrupt role play situations. It's not appropriate to show up with a minigun and kill a group of players standing together chatting for instance, do not use more violence than the situation require.
#6 Do not spam the chats, repeating nonsense on purpose will lead to a mute, note that this mute are global and applies to many other servers running GTW-RPG resources as well.
#7 Do NOT try this in game: apply for staff, suggest new features, complaint on other players or staff, ask about stuff you'll find information about in the list to the left. This is not punishable but you may not get the response you expected.
#8 Do not actively troll, provoke, annoy or insult other players. Instead, solve your conflicts here: Report/Appeal: https://forum.404rq.com/complaints-and-reports/

Thank you for complying with our rules.

#1 Geen andere spelers spawnkillen. (Geld rond ziekenhuizen)
#2 Rijd aan de rechterkant van de weg. Blokkeer geen andere spelers, rijd niet in andere spelers zonder een geldige reden. bv. in een politie achtervolging of wraak.
#3 Gebruik geen soort van hack of misbruik geen bugs. GTW-RPG is een open source game modus waarbij we zeggen dat hij stabiel en van hoge kwaliteit is, het is daarom belangrijk dat je ons laat weten van een bug die je vind. Bug reports zijn beloonbaar, misbruik is strafbaar.
#4 Adverteer niet, voel je vrij om over alles te praten zolang je het niet adverteerd. Als je het verschil niet snapt dan is hier een voorbeeld: Praten: Xbox vs PS3... Adverteren: Koop je Xbox hier...
#5 Onderbreek of belemmer rolspel situaties niet. Het is niet volwassen om met een minigun te komen en een groep van spelers die aan het praten zijn te vermoorden, gebruik niet meer geweld dan dat de situatie nodig heeft.
#6 Spam de chat niet, onzin herhalen met opzet zal leiden tot een mute, denk eraan dat deze mute globaal werkt en dus in alle andere GTW servers werken.
#7 Probeer dit spel NIET: soliciteren voor personeel, nieuwe kenmerken aanvragen, klagen over de andere spelers of personeel, iets vragen dat je in de lijst links van dit kan vinden. Dit is niet strafbaar maar het kan zijn dat je je verwachtte antwoord niet krijgt.
#8 Ga niet actief trollen, provoceren, irriteren of spelers uitschelden. Inplaats daarvan, los je problemen hier op: https://forum.404rq.com/complaints-and-reports/

#1 Non spawn-killare gli altri giocatori. (Questa regola vale vicino agli ospedali)
#2 Guida sul lato destro della strada. Non bloccare gli altri giocatori, non schiantarti contro gli altri giocatori a meno che non hai una ragione per farlo, per esempio in un inseguimento o per vendetta.
#3 Non usare nessun tipo di hack e non abusare dei bug. GTW-RPG è una modalità di gioco open source che affermiamo sia stabile e di alta qualità, quindi è importante notificarci riguardo qualsiasi bug che riesci a trovare. Vieni ricompensato se segnali un bug, ma vieni punito se abusi di un exploit.
#4 Non pubblicizzare, sii libero di parlare di qualsiasi cosa purché non la pubblicizzi. Se non capisci la differenza, eccoti un esempio: Parlare: xBox vs PS3... Pubblicizzare: compra la xBox qua...
#5 Non ostruire o interrompere situazioni role play. Non è appropriato presentarsi con una minigun e uccidere un gruppo di giocatori che stanno insieme a parlare per esempio, non usare più violenza di quanto la situazione richiede.
#6 Non spammare nelle chat, ripetere cose senza senso porterà ad essere mutati,tieni conto che questo mute è globale e viene applicato a molti altri server che usano le risorse di GTW-RPG.
#7 NON fare questo nel gioco: chiedere per diventare staff, suggerire nuove idee, lamentarsi di altri giocatori o staffer, chiedere cose ovvie allo staff che puoi trovare nella lista alla tua sinistra. Questo non è punibile ma potrai non ottenere la riposta che ti aspettavi.
#8 Non trollare, provocare, annoiare o insultare gli altri giocatori. Invece, risolvi i tuoi conflitti qua: https://forum.404rq.com/complaints-and-reports/

#3 Missbruka inte eventuella buggar, GTW-RPG är baserat på öppen källkod och bör vara stabilt, belöning utlovas till den som upptäcker och rapporterar buggar beroende på dess storlek, missbruk av buggar bestraffas.
#4 Reklam är ej tillåten, vi tillämpar yttrandefrihet så du får självklart prata om precis vad du vill, så länge du inte öppet gör reklam för en produkt exempelvis.
#5 Avbryt ej rolspel, servern stödjer både role-play och RPG, om en grupp spelare står och sysslar med /me och /do rollspel är det olämpligt att dyka upp med minigun och ha ihjäl dem eller meja ner dem med din bil.
#6 SPAM är ej tillåten, toleransen här är dock hög men får du en varning bör du lugna dig en aning.
#7 Administrativa uppgifter delas INTE ut till den som skriker högst, detsamma gäller för serverns utveckling (förslag och dylikt) samt klagomål på andra spelare med mera, allt sånt hanteras i forumet.

Where the game is a true pleasure, we started as a small hobby project to give some new life to a bunch of old gaming PC's, thanks to the great Linux distribution "Debian" and a overkill network in northern Europe RageQuit has been growing over a couple of years and is now running multiple Multi Theft Auto and Minecraft servers.

As our main interest always been the development we don't put much effort in limitations of the free speech or other bureocratic "rules", instead we're trying to make our game mode enjoyable for as many players as possible, this includes everything from design details to pure performance, we hate FPS lag and bad ping just as much as you do.

We're one of feew communities almost completly built on open source software, especially the GTW-RPG project for Multi Theft Auto which we are the main contributors to. We also offers total freedom of speech and high security on our servers so that you don't have to loose any of your valuable game progress or items you worked hard for.

* How to prevent high latency
***********************************************************************

High latency occurs for two reasons, either the network is overloaded or you're very far away from the server, consider for instance if you're connected to a wireless network with lot's of disturbances (which pretty much all wireless networks has more or less).

To prevent high latency you neet to consider these two things:
  * If possible, use a cable network rather than a wireless one. That should reduce your latency to max 400 no matter where in the world you're located, (lower values applies to Europe and USA since that's our location).
  * Avoid downloading files while playing, especially torrent files and similar which tends to overflow local networks, also make sure noone else on the same network aren't downloading anything in the background.

What happens when the latency is too high?
We block some features for you temporary, in worst case scenario we kick you. These systems are automatic so don't blame online staff for your own high latency.

There are two ways to redcue your wanted level:

  * Paying your fines, use /fine to see how much it will cost and follow the instructions on your screen to accept or reject, you can not pay a fine when a law enforcer is nearby.

Already arrested? don't worry there might still be hope:
  * Offer to bribe the cop who arrested you, this is risky tho and they may scam you, scam is allowed during Bribery

In jail? don't worry there might still be hope:
  * You can escape from jail, see the "Jail" section for more details

except for law units, unless they are trying to help a criminal
escape. The place is only reachable by boat or helicopter and
prison guards has multiple spawners for these vehicles around

To escape, you need to get far away from the jail, unnoticed and
survive both rockets and potential guards that may notice your
escape attempt, a successfull escape attempt will  gice you 10
stars, (making it the worst crime you can commit).
