## Maps
Maps are a type of xml files used to move, add or remove in game objects that belongs to the map. As Multi Theft Auto offers a great map editor for Grand Theft Auto San Andreas you'll also find some great maps in this project. Like the core map for instance which contains details all over the world to make everything look more realistic. A jail island for our jail resource and some bases for groups and gangs. As of 2017 all maps in this directory are converted to Lua using this converter: https://lua.wuss.pw/
