Misc is a folder of resources forked from mtasa default resources [https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-resources], 
and from [http://community.mtasa.com]. Some of them are slightly modified, others are just upgraded to work with new 
versions of MTA. Resources like for instance "_interiors_" (to enter shops), "_realdriveby_" or "_parachute_" plays an 
important role to make the GTW-RPG project even more amazing.

Resources in this folder comes with different licensing options and standalone authors, if you plan to use them please respect their individual licensing and authors conditions of usage.
