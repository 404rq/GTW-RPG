Misc is a folder of resources forked from mtasa default resources [https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-resources], 
and a few other sources. Some of them are slightly modified, others are just upgraded to work with new versions of MTA. 
In common these resources also has an important role within the GTW-RPG project, "_interiors_" to enter shops, "_realdriveby_" 
or "_parachute_" to save time by providing useful features. And shaders to make everything look nicer.
