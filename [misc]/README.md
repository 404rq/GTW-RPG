Misc is a folder of resources forked from mtasa default resources [https://github.com/multitheftauto/mtasa-resources], 
and from [http://community.mtasa.com]. Some of them are slightly modified, others are just upgraded to work with new 
versions of MTA. Resources like for instance "_interiors_" (to enter shops), "_realdriveby_" or "_parachute_" plays an 
important role to make the GTW-RPG project to what it is today. 

Although it would be great with 100% own work there are also other great resources licenced under GPL v3.0 which also 
fits within the project, slightly modified or non modified, important is to keep the original authors credits and respect 
their individual licensing rules, to keep things simple all these resources are available within this misc folder so you 
don't accidently mix them with GTW resources.

Our future goal is however to write our own replacements for all this resources, but for now there are other ideas that
has a little higher priority to maximize the amount of features and keep the game mode stable, optimized and interesting
to play.
