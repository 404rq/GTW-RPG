Hello! Thank you for the download!
======================================

How to Install:

At first you need a MySQL Server. I used the MTA Database functions, so the mysql-module is not in use.
Set up the server, and execute the .sql file, that is located in this folder.

To change the connection settings, go in the server.lua file and sorch for the connection handler-commentary.
You can change also a few settings.

Do not remove the credits!

You can create a house using /createhouse.
If the script doesn't work, chech with /debugscript 3 for errors.

If you see any bugs, please write an E-mail to me: Noneatme@hotmail.de, or post it somewhere in the forum. Thank you!
