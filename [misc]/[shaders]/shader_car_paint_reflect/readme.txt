Resource: Shader Car Paint reflect
Video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIfxp4hJgPs

Update 0.2.4
-Reapplied the gtasa fog for SM3 effect

Update 0.2.3
-Rewritten the effects. Applied a better reflection method
-Imported effect from car_paint_fix: skylight
-Added minZviewAngleFade variable

The reflection is based on screen source, giving an illusion 
of realtime reflection. Effect is similar to what is seen in ENB.  
It is applied to vehicle paint and windshields.
The effect requires (just as the carpaint shader) PS Model 2.0 GFX.
So it will run on almost anything.

Update:
-the effect uses up to all 4 pointlights for vehicle lighting
-added switching option (event and /sCarReflect)

have fun
