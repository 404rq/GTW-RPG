Grand Theft Walrus
=======

This is a free and open RPG gamemode for Multi Theft Auto (Modification to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas), written in lua. It's inspired by the gigants in functionality, game logic and features but without limitations for the players. Instead it's balanced by consequences for those who doesn't play "realistic", the main goal with this project is realism, like a combination between Roleplay and Action based roleplay (ARPG or RPG if you prefer that instead). Contributions can be done by anyone at http://code.albonius.com, however, access to this page require you to be a member in GTW Code, read more about how you can become that here: http://games.albonius.com/staff-applications/developer-team-application-guidelines/

Core features
=======
The most important resources are the core features, basically scripts which many other scripts depends on and with many exports, this includes a job management system which handles GUI, teams and other important things related to civilian jobs, a top bar dx message system used by almost all resources to display important information to the players in a more nice looking way. Grand Theft Walrus game servers uses an individual core resource that handle information such as gamemode, time and other related stuff beside these resources, there's also a couple of standalone resources from MTA community which we can't unclude in this project for obvious reasons, since they are optional we won't list them here.

Details
=======
Beside the standardized core features, this project also includes a lot of misc features that might not be the first you think of when it comes to RPG but still pretty interesting, GTWtrains is a typical example of that, a system that manage and control AI trains around the map, trains that can be used to travel between the three cities or why not block people during car chases. Smaller features that we consider as "details" such as GTWsmoke which handles some smoking animations etc. Please note that this isn't the full gamemode running at Grand Thest Walrus game servers, in fact, it's the opposite. We are working to extend this gamemode however and more resources will be published as soon they are rewritten to work on other servers than just our own. The reason are for example usage of exports to private resources or dependencies of many large resources, where some of them is badly written currently.
