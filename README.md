# Grand Theft Walrus - RPG
The most advanced open source RPG/Real life game mode for Multi Theft Auto. Grand Theft Walrus RPG (*or GTW-RPG*) was initially created to fill the empty space between more traditional RPG servers, where most players are just running around like headless chickens, and hardcore role play servers where players are enforced to act strictly like they would in real life.

## How does it work?
GTW-RPG is basically a directory of individual resources with various purposes, some of them has dependencies while others works individually. All resources are highly optimized in order to provide a lag free experience, even on servers with poor performance. 

## Live demo
Our live server (*powered by [99Stack](https://www.99stack.com)*) is online 24x7 and runs the latest version of GTW-RPG.
