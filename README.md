Grand Theft Walrus
=======

Advanced, free and open RPG gamemode for Multi Theft Auto (Modification to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas), inspired by the gigants in functionality, game logic and features but without limitations for the players. Instead it's balanced by consequences for those who doesn't play "realistic", the main goal with this project is realism, like a combination between Roleplay and Action based roleplay (RPG). Contributions may be done by anyone but to gain more access you need a membership in GTW Code, read more about that here:

Core features
=======
The most important resources are the core features, basically scripts which many other scripts depends on and with many exports, this includes a job management system which handles GUI, teams and other important things related to civilian jobs, a top bar dx message system used by almost all resources to display important information to the players in a more nice looking way.

Details
=======
Beside the standardized core features, this project also includes a lot of misc features that might not be the first you think of when it comes to RPG but still pretty interesting, GTWtrains is a typical example of that, a system that manage and control AI trains around the map, trains that can be used to travel between the three cities or why not block people during car chases. Smaller features that we consider as "details" such as GTWsmoke which handles some smoking animations etc.
