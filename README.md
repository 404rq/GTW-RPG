# GTW-RPG
This is a free, advanced and open Real life/RPG game mode and core for the game modification Multi Theft Auto (Modification to Grand Theft Auto San Andreas). It's inspired by the most famous RPG servers in functionality, game logic and features but without limitations for the players. It's also optimized to run well on older hardware without reducing functionality or graphical design. 
GTW-RPG is balanced by consequences for those who doesn't play "realistic", examples on that would for example be reduced payments in civilian jobs if the vehicle is damaged as well as an over sensitive wanted level system. The main goal with this project is realism, like a combination between Roleplay and Action based roleplay (ARPG or RPG if you prefer those terms instead). As the project is open, anyone may contribute, read more about that in our contributing file. 

## Live demo
A live demo server running the game mode is available here: mtasa://104.238.188.170:22004, powered by RageQuit 404 community (404rq)

## Project goals
What's the goal of this project:
* High amount of useful features, especially misc features to ensure there's always something to do and avoid players being bored
* Extremly low performance specifications, the game mode must run just as fine on a 15 years old laptop (as server) as it does on the top of the line servers, (note that we don't want to limit functionality, some features are allowed to use more CPU time, but as long it can be more efficient it must be optimized).
* High quality, official releases should not contain semi-finished features or trash code (and if possible exclude all known bugs).
* Independency, you should not be forced to use the entire gamemode just because you're looking for a single feature, individual resources may be used as well and we try to document all resources in their readme files with available exports and if needed, required dependencies, (a common dependency are for instance GTWtopbar which is required from almost all included resources).

## Testing the software
The latest version of these resources will always run on our servers: (mtasa://104.238.188.170:22004 for instance). These servers are open 24/7 for anyone who would like to join and try this game mode live as well as contributing by testing and report potential bugs you may find. You can also join the staff team in our community "RageQuit 404" to help out testing this game mode by playing the most recent version of it as soon it's released and give us feedback. Applications and information for that are found here:<br>

**Important** These servers also contains resources that is not included in GTW-RPG. If you efter face a "missing feature" in your copy then it's a part of our servers rather than the game mode. Features that is not yet implemented will be released in the future, and thus you must not report them as "bugs" or spam our fourm (or any other place for that matter) claiming the game mode is broken.

# Core features
The most important resources are the core features, basically scripts which many other scripts depends on and with many exports, this includes a job management system which handles the GUI to apply for a job, team and other important things related to civilian jobs, a top bar dx message system used by almost all resources to display important notifications to the players in a more nice looking way. GTW Games servers uses an individual core resource that handle information such as gamemode, time and other related stuff beside these resources, there's also a couple of standalone resources made by developers who prefer other licenses than GNU which we can't unclude in this project for obvious reasons, since they are optional we won't list them here.

# Details
Beside the standardized core features, this project also includes a lot of misc features that might not be the first you think of when it comes to RPG but still pretty interesting, GTWtrains is a typical example of that, a system that manage and control AI trains around the map, trains that can be used to travel between the three cities or why not block people during car chases. Smaller features that we consider as "details" such as GTWsmoke which handles some smoking animations etc. Please note that this isn't the full gamemode running at Grand Thest Walrus game servers, in fact, it's the opposite. We are working to extend this gamemode however and more resources will be published as soon they are rewritten to work on other servers than just our own. The reason are for example usage of exports to private resources or dependencies of many large resources, where some of them is badly written currently.
