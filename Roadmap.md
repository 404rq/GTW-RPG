# Roadmap & History
The is the project history and it's future goals summarized.

## GTW-RPG v4.0 (Closed development)
v4.0 is the version most of us is currently working on, it's based on v3.0 but will be the first version that is 100% open source. 
It will also be released with a clean database to ensure fair game play and give everyone a fresh start.

**Features in v4.0**
* 100% open source
* Language support will be fully implemented (which languages that is available from start depends on contributions), we'll add the original English transaltions
* More missions in current Civilian jobs and more jobs, we'll focus on interesting non monotomatic jobs to keep the game more interesting
* Balanced economy, with a fresh restart we can finally build a realistic economic system that rewards realism and activity while it punishes trolls and those who ruin the game
* Clean code, optimization and improved security (failsafe defaults) to reduce the risk of new bugs and issues
* Online stats, best players in all categories will be automatically listed on 404rq.com
* Improved account system, we'll connect in game accounts with forum accounts (or 404rq.com accounts), this ensures security for your personal information, allows account restoration and reduce the amount of spam accounts we've seen in previous verisons.

## GTW-RPG v3.0 (Current release)
v3.0 started brougt a lot of resources from closed to open source, it added many new features and 
optimizations as well as bug fixing but it still has many remaining issues from the old v1 resources 
that can't really be resolved without resetting accounts and stats. v3.0 is the current version 
running on our current servers and further development has pretty much ended after the work on v4.0 started.

## GTW-RPG v2.0
This was the first version with some open source resources, it was released back in the year of 2012 as a 
rewrite of some of the work in v1, this is the first version where complete resources where rewritten for 
better optimization, less bugs and issues and a more clean code. New features where implemented as well.

## GTW-RPG v1.0 (also known as Artic community)
The first pack of resources produced by Mr_Moose at 404rq's ancestor "Artic community" or simply AC. 
The resources where basic but functional for it's time back in 2009, but not very well written Mr_Moose
admits. Yet they where optimized and somewhat close to best practices. The only server using it back 
then (due to closed source) was powered by an old HP compaq nx7000 laptop running Linux.

GTW-RPG started as an alternative to non realistic and laggy RPG servers with large player bases, 
although GTW-RPG has never been as realistic as a typical roleplay server it was originally (and 
it still are) supposed to be something between RPG and roleplay, kind of like "realistic RPG" by 
using logical and fair scripts to deal with rule breakers rather than staff controlled by feelings.
